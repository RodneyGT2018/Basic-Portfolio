            <hr>
            <p><img src="assets/images/ProfilePhoto.jpeg" alt="ProfilePhoto" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-right:20px;">Thank you for visiting my page.  I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia.  I have a B.S. in Financial Management from Clemson University and an MBA from Arizona State University.  I enjoy spending my free time visiting friends, watching sports, working out, and occasionally officiating a wedding.  And when officiating weddings, I try to insert something humerous inside my segments to ensure everyone is paying attention.  My passion for technology and prior professional experience has led me to the Georgia Tech Bootcamp for full stack web development.  My goal is to absorb as much of the bootcamp experience and best practices as possible while beginning to connect with professionals within the coding network of Atlanta.  Try to stay awake, it's almost over.  Atlanta has become a technological playground for a number of large companies.  My goal after completing the bootcamp is to connect with key stakeholders withing those companies seeking coding talent.  Specifically, I hope to learn how these companies utilize their developers to make a profit and how I can contribute in that forum.  I would also like to explore the long-term career paths that exist after beginning in a developer role with a company.  Contacts I have made in the field of coding thus far have emphasized a need for individuals that can understand the principals and theoretical approach to web development and translate the feasibiltiy of project accomplishment to Senior Management.  Conversely, those same individuals expressed a desire to understand the needs of Senior Management as it relates to increasing profits with respect to internal and external programming deliverables.  I believe my experience will enable that bridge of understanding once I am able to complete this bootcamp.</p>
